Telegram has always been about chats.  
Now — it’s about spaces.

**Nodes** are independent communication spaces inside Telegram. They bring chats, calls, events, and people together around a topic, a team, or a community — without cluttering your main chat list.

> Nodes help keep work discussions, projects, and communities organized — as fast and simple as regular Telegram chats.

#### Everything in its place

Each Node is its own world with structure:

- text chats for discussions,
- voice and video chats for meetings,
- boards for announcements and pinned information,
- an activity feed so you can see what’s happening right now.

Switch between sections instantly — a tap or a swipe, no extra screens.

#### Chats that don’t get lost

In Nodes, chats don’t compete for attention.

- conversations are split by topic  
- important messages are easy to pin  
- history stays readable even in large communities  

> To get started, open a Node and choose **Chats** — create rooms, pin important items, and configure access.

#### Voice and video where you need it

Nodes are built for more than messaging.

In one tap you can:
- join a voice conversation,
- start a video meeting,
- toggle your mic and camera,
- keep chatting and share files at the same time.

Participants with video on appear right in the interface — clear and live, without feeling like a separate app.

#### A separate identity for each Node

Inside a Node, you can present yourself as needed:

- a separate name,
- a separate avatar,
- a short bio.

Perfect if you use Telegram for workspaces, communities, and personal projects at once.

#### Familiar. But new.

Nodes don’t replace Telegram — they extend it.

Touch interactions feel natural, elements animate smoothly, and navigation stays unified — as if it always worked this way.

> Nodes are Telegram’s next step: for teams, communities, and anyone who wants structure without losing simplicity.
